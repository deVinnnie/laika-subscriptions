## Changing Hibernate's sequence value

Had to do the following to resolve a conflict between the autogenerated id's and existing records in the database.
Hibernate's sequence started at 0, incrementing with each new subscription, and finally hitting a duplicate key exception,
since an existing record already used that id.

```
> heroku pg:psql
select * from hibernate_sequence;
SELECT setval('hibernate_sequence', 100);
```
